# PDF2SearchablePDF
`pdf2searchablepdf <input.pdf> [output.pdf]` = voila! output.pdf now has searchable text!

# Description:
`tesseract` has the ability to do OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on image files, but unfortunately NOT on PDF files as inputs. This is unfortunate, as it means it's a pain to try to convert a PDF to a searchable PDF, so this is an attempt at scripting the process using existing tools in order to make it stupid-simple for ANYONE to use!
